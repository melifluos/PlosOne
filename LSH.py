Generate an LSH table from minhashes

n = 1000.0  # the number of hashes in a signature
b = 500.0  # the number of bands to use - this satisfies thresh ~ (1/b)^(b/n)
r = n / b

The probability that two signatures will hash to one or more identical buckets
is given by 1 - (1-J^r)^b

If one hash function puts two columns in the same bucket, then we regard them as similar

Divide the minhash signatures into b bands each containing r rows

For each band create a hash function with ~ 10^9 buckets (ideally we want no collisions
, but in practice this is impossible)

This means that signatures will only be guaranteed to hash to the same bucket if
they have identical values in one of the bands

Our threshold is quite low and so we need a high b and low r
